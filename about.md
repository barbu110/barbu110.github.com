First of all, I am Victor. I am a student who __loves__ programming.
I participated in Google Code-in 2015 and worked for Wikimedia Foundation.
After the contest, I decided I would keep contributing to MediaWiki, 
since what I do, what I contribute with, will be used by millions of
users accessing wikis, probably... every day.
